# FeedbackApp | Portfolio Work

This is simple Full Stack Application for my portfolio. Imagine you are a startup owner or a product manager who
created or developed some type of application or service. Users are making use of your application or service but you notice
that recently users stop using you service all together. So why users are quiting your service? This Application will solve the issue.

[FeedbackApp](https://sheltered-bastion-46108.herokuapp.com/)

1. Ask your customers why they quit.
2. Collects some amount of feedback from customers so product manager can understand them.
3. Send customers an email requesting feedback.
4. Customers send feedback, then the application tabulate or summerize feedback into one set of results.

> TODO: Build a feedback collection application that will be marketed to startup owners, product owners and product managers so they can collect feedback from individual users.
